 ## 1)OOPS Concepts
 [Link of OOPS Concepts Examples in my Repo](https://github.com/kattakapilkumar/Java/tree/master/src/collection).
    These are important object oriented programming system Concepts
    1) Data Hiding
    2) Abstraction
    3) Encapsulation
    4) Tightly Encapsulated Class
    5) Inheritance
       i)  Is - A - Relationship

  ## 2)Type-Casting
######     1) Variable Type-Casting

######     2) Object Type-Casting
[Link to Examples of Object-TypeCasting in my Repo](https://github.com/kattakapilkumar/Java/tree/master/src/object_TypeCasting).

 ## 2)Exception Handling 
       Error vs Exception
       1) Recovering from Error is not possible. The only solution to errors is to terminate the execution. 
       Where as you can recover from Exception by using either try-catch blocks or throwing exception back to caller.
######  Error : An Error "indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch."
######  Exception : An Exception "indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch."
